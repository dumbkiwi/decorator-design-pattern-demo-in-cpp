# decorator-design-pattern-demo-in-cpp
This is a simple demo of the Decorator design pattern.

Demo scenario: In an interview, a online milktea vendor wants you to design a system to evaluate the cost of an order, emphasizing that you implement this system using the Decorator Design pattern so that a hypothetical team of developers can confidently extend the functionality of the system in the future.

Here, the system must be able to calculate the cost of a cup of milktea PLUS the client's selected add-ons (bubbles, jelly, toppings, etc.).

Use the Decorator Design Pattern to ensure the new add-ons can be implemented in the future without modification to the original design.
